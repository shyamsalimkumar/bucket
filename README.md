BUCKET
======

You might've heard of [Hub](http://hub.github.com/), a commandline helper to ease [Github](https://github.com/) development.
It is very simple and has many easy to use features like 

* Cloning a repo.
* Forking a repo.
* Creating a new repo
* Browsing the repo code and its wiki.
* Sending a pull request to the cloned repo.

All this without having to open a browser. I was truly astonished by the level of complexity that it could do. 
It is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I initially thought of recreating the same by forking the code and just replacing the github specific code, but that would be too boring to do and I wouldn't feel a sense of satisfaction that one gets when he builds something afresh.


Bucket is just a commandline helper similar to Hub but for [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) instead of Github.
