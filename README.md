BUCKET
======

You might've heard of [Hub](http://hub.github.com/), a commandline helper to each Github development.
It is very simple and has many easy to use features like 

* Cloning a repo.
* Forking a repo.
* Creating a new repo (without using the web interface).
* Browsing the repo code and its wiki.
* Sending a pull request to the cloned repo.
